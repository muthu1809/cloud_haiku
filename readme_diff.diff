 Version control isn't just for code. It's for anything you want to track, including content. Using Git to manage your next writing project gives you the ability to view multiple drafts at the same time,  see differences between those drafts, and even roll back to a previous version. And if you're comfortable doing so, you can then share your work with others on GitHub or other central git repositories.
 
 In this tutorial you'll use Git to manage a small Markdown document. You'll store an initial version, commit it, make changes, view the difference between those changes, and review the previous version. When you're done, you'll have a workflow you can apply to your own writing projects.
